    <h1>Bootstrap Features</h1>
    <br />
    <h3>Navbar</h3>
    <p>The Navigation bar is split into 3 parts.</p>
    <p>1) The banner : I decided to have a banner that lets the user know this is my portfolio site where they can 
        read more about me. I feel this is very informative for the user which is key in visualisations and user experience.
    </p>
    <p>I also added a dropdown menu to the banner so users can see other features on the site. I thought this
        was a good idea as it doesnt cram the navbar with too many headings and overflow the user with too much information and buttons. I feel its good for the user experience to split
        the heading into 2 navigation sections. I kept the most important features on the navbar.
    </p>
    <p>2) The rainbow bar : A skinny line which goes between the banner and navigation bar, the rainbow line adds a bit of colour to the site and
        blends in with the site nicely.
    </p>
    <p>3) The navigation bar : the navbar is simple but effective, it gets to the point but still uses a lot of style in the font size, style and weight 
        and the use of icons add a nice touch too the user experience. The navbar makes accessibility for user experience easy and efficient.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Parralax</h3>
    <p>I used a parralax with an image in the background of a laptop. This lets the user know that its a computing portfolio site about me.</p>
    <p>I also think the parallax adds a nice design effect to the site while also splitting the site into its different sections.
        It also adds consistency to the site which I feel is important for user experience.
    </p>  
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Rows & Columns</h3>
    <p>Throughout most of the site I used rows and columns dividing up the content on the site or separating images.</p>
    <p>Users are used to sites being divided up neatly and I think bootstrap rows and columns are the best 
        way to deliver this.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Modal</h3>
    <p>For the about me section I used Modals to show more information about me and also show my skills.
        I think a modal is a good idea because you can give the user the option to look at more detail without overflowing the 
        page with too much content, the user can decide if he/she wants to see more or not.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Buttons</h3>
    <p>I used buttons throughout the site becasue no matter what site you go onto they always use buttons for functionality.
        User feedback is critical in designing a site and most users like to use buttons to that is why I used them.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>row featurettes</h3>
    <p>In one of my modals I used a row featurette to divide up my site.</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Panels</h3>
    <p>In my interests section I used panels to divide my content and images.
        I thought panels were a good idea here as they add a bit of colour and fun to the 
        site which further portrays my interests and personality.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Tabs</h3>
    <p>I used tabs for my grades so user can tab through each year of results</p>
    <p>I think this increases user learnability as they can easily tab through each year and 
        clearly understand the grades section.
    </p>
    <p>I also used tabs for my projects section. Here users can easily see my projects by tabbing through each.
        This keeps the content on this section to a minimum yet provides the user with a lot of info on 
        each project.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Carousel</h3>
    <p>I used a carousel for my projects to show the user different images of my projects. 
        I think this adds to memorability in the site. The use of content and a carousel for imagery 
        makes the user experience more memorable.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Map</h3>
    <p>I used a map to show where I am. This allows a user to know how far I am from them if they ever 
        wanted to meet up or offer work.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />

    <h1>Javascript Features</h1>
    <br />
    <h3>Form and function to return Email results</h3>
    <p>I added a function to allow the user to sent an email.
    The email fuctionality doesnt work but it does return the user there email results.</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Search Bar function</h3>
    <p>I added a javascript search bar that when the user searches it routes them to google.</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Show More Button</h3>
    <p>The show more button returns the user more results. I used this for the education and work experience section.</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <hr />
    <h1>JQuery Features</h1>
    <br />
    <h3>JQuery function for smooth scrolling</h3>
    <p>I added a jquery function that allows a user to smooth scroll through the site. I feel this is an important feature 
        in the site and for user experience as it allows a user to see clearly what they are doing and the page doesnt jump abruptly.
    </p>
